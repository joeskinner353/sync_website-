## Automated Sync Process

- **Trigger**: Any push to main branch
- **Action**: GitHub Actions automatically syncs changes to all version branches
- **Preservation**: Each branch maintains its specific site-version.js file
- **Deployment**: Netlify automatically deploys each branch to its respective URL

## Creating a New Version

1. **Add to Version Matrix**: Update `.github/workflows/sync-version-branches.yml`
2. **Update This Document**: Add new version to the table above
3. **Create Branch**: GitHub Actions will create the branch on next main push
4. **Configure Netlify**: Set up new Netlify site for the new branch
5. **Update Database**: Add composers with the new site_version value

## Version History

- **version_1** (Current): Launched with enhanced video player and navigation features
- **version_2** (Active): Branch created for composers tagged with version_2
- **version_4** (Planned): Reserved for new composer roster
- **version_5** (Planned): Reserved for future expansion
